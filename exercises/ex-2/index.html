         <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening - Robert Frost</h1>
        </header>

     <p>Whose woods these are I think I know</p>
     <p>His house is in the village though</p>
     <p>He will not see me stopping here</p>
     <p>To watch his woods fill up with snow</p>

     <p>My little horse must think it queer</p>   
     <p>To stop without a farmhouse near</p>   
        <p>Between the woods and frozen lake</p>   
        <p>The darkest evening of the year.</p>
        
        <p>He gives his harness bells a shake</p>  
        <p>To ask if there is some mistake.</p>   
        <p>The only other soundâ€™s the sweep</p>   
        <p>Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>   
        
        <p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</p>   
        <p>But I have promises to keep,</p>   
        <p>And miles to go before I sleep,</p>   
        <p>And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
