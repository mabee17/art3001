    <p>This is Kendall's sketchbook! It has a thin layer of dust. Maybe she doesn't draw too much nowadays?</p>

    <p>You flip through the pages. There are many detailed drawings, mostly of her cat. You can tell a lot of care went into each.</p>

    <p>On the last page, the word "Ideas" is listed at the top. There is nothing else on the page. Perhaps she's been feeling uninspired lately?</p>

    <p>Let's look at <a href="index.html">something else</a>.</p>
