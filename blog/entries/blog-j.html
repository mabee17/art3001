     <p>This is my tenth blog post. Still living at home and it's almost April. The days honestly feel like
        kind of a blur. Maybe I've said this before, but school feels like just a bunch of tasks I have to
        get done sometimes rather than actually feeling like school. Every time I see a school bus it hits me
        (like a bus) that there are elementary and middle and high school kids who literally get up and sit in
        classes for like seven hours a day. I think if I tried to do that now it would kill me. I'm always afraid
        I'm supposed to be talking about school related stuff in these but I don't like to think about school, so 
        I always just talk about something else such as how I've been living at home for a month. These entries may
        be repetitive and boring at times, but at least that means they're successful at reflecting my life right now.
        That was a really depressing sentence. I swear I've actually been doing surprisingly good, just completely
        burnt out with school. Blah.
