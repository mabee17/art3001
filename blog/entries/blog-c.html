     <p>This is my third blog post. I think I'm going to start all of these by annoucing what number it is
         because it's lowkey funny. Or my sense of humor is warped. Anyways, we're finally getting to that
         point that happens every semester where classes slowly switch from easy "getting back to school"
         assignments to piling on the big stuff.
