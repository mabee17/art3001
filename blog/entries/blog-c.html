     <p>This is my third blog post. I think I'm going to start all of these by annoucing what number it is
         because it's lowkey funny. Or my sense of humor is warped. Anyways, we're finally getting to that
         point that happens every semester where classes slowly switch from easy "getting back to school"
         assignments to piling on the big stuff. I'm still getting used to just having school again, and
         honestly my motivation is... not great right now. I'm not sure what else to type. So far February
         has been a bit calmer than January, which I guess is a good thing. Let's hope it stays that way,
         at least for a little while. I feel like I should add a picture or video or something to all of these 
         entries, even if I don't really have anything particular in mind, so enjoy this sick video of possums
         eating fruit. I know that's not how you spell possums. I don't care.
