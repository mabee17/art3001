     <p>This is my seventh blog post. So, my two weeks of class off have come to an end, which means I should
        be heading back to my dorm. But, in a fun turn of events, my parents are going out of town and need me
        to stay home to watch the cat. Yahoo! Well... Maybe. I don't think it's good to be traveling in the 
        pandemic. But they're going down to Florida because my grandparents are going down to Florida and need
        some help getting there. Every winter they literally migrate like geese down there for the season, but 
        they didn't this year because of the pandemic. So they're going now because it's a bit safer. Each week 
        these entries get exponentially worse. I do quite literally nothing outside of school, which means sometimes 
        the only thing I have to talk about is what my parents are doing. How am I twenty years old?
