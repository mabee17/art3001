     <p>This is my sixth blog post. As of right now I am staying at home! To make a long story short I somehow 
        got two weeks of in person classes off. I still have some online though. But anyways. Whenever I'm at my
        dorm if I'm not doing homework I just sit there. My roommates are lowkey anti-social, and don't get me wrong
        I am too, but it does lead to us never really talking or doing anything. And in combination with the pandemic
        it still feels like there's nothing to do on campus. So now I am home. Man this entry sucks. I'm the type of
        person that starts a journal and doesn't keep it for more than three days because I literally don't know
        what to say. Maybe I should work on that...
