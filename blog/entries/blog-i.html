     <p>This is my ninth blog post. As of today, I have been living at home for a month now. Yeah. It's rewind
         time! So I went home for those two weeks I had off of class. THEN I found out my parents were going out
         of town for 10 days to help my grandparents travel down to Florida, and they needed someone to feed
         the cat. So I just stayed home for those days too and drove to campus for my in person classes (I live
         close). But now it has been a month which is lowkey awkward. Told my roommates I would be back soon but
         I honestly have a feeling that is not going to happen. When I'm home I have my entire room and my entire
         kitchen and my family and my cat. Now that I'm used to that I really don't wanna go back.
