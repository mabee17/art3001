     <p>This is my first blog post. I have never done something like this for a 
        class before, and have tried and failed many times to keep a journal, so
        writing down my thoughts without a specific subject in mind to talk about
        is very new to me. I can't help but feel a bit awkward (lol). Anyways,
        right now I'm directing most of my energy towards mentally adapting to having
        schoolwork again. It's amazing how unadjusted you can become to the idea
        of going to classes during a break that's just barely over a month long. It's
        like when you miss a week of going to the gym after going every day for a month,
        and suddenly you've forgotten how it feels to lift a weight. I don't know why
        that was the first analogy to come to mind considering I haven't stepped foot
        in a gym in literal years. You'll probably learn pretty quickly from these blog
        posts of mine that I have adhd (don't worry, I'm medicated!). Moving on... Regarding
        coding I am very much a beginner, but thankfully I have found myself able to follow
        along well with our lectures and I am excited to see what sorts of projects we will
        end up making and how it will tie more into creating art. One last note: the cat image
        above is from google images, and I was going to find another image instead, but it saved
        under the name "happycat_1024.jpg", and I found that too endearing to delete. Ok. Bye! :)</p>
