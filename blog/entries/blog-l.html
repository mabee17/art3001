        <h1>Blog</h1>

     <p>This is my twelfth blog post. I guess this will also proabably be my final blog post too... Thinking back to
        the first one literally feels like a lifetime ago, and yet I feel like this year is going by so quickly. 
        Anyways... I want to use this post to thank you two (Dalena and Hirad) for a great semester. I really
        appreciate that we've had assignments like this where I don't have to study or know certain information
        to complete them and I can just talk about whatever is in my brain (which apparently hasn't been much LMAO).
        This semester has somehow been my least productive yet one of the most exhausting in my lifetime. I have
        a feeling I should not be saying that, but whenever I hear other people say stuff like that it either makes
        me laugh or is extremely relatable. Or both. I feel like I need to say something meaningful to wrap this 
        up, but I'm not the best at final sign offs. We still have two weeks of class left so it doesn't feel like
        a final sign off yet, so I guess I will say... See you soon! :)
