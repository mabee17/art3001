     <p>This is my tenth blog post. APRIL FOOLS! It's my eleventh blog post. I am so funny. I gotta say
        April Fools is a pretty entertaining holiday. I never really participate in it myself, but I love
        seeing people post how they got pranked online. Now that I'm thinking about it, almost all of the pranks
        I can remember are food related? I remember one where a person replaced the icing in oreos with toothpaste,
        and another where a person took a windex bottle (which has blue cleaning liquid), rinsed it out really well,
        filled it with blue gatorade, and then walked around drinking it. It feels like nowadays pranks like that 
        are just an average Tik Tok video. OOOOOOH I just remembered this video where this guy pranks a bird by
        doing that blanket trick and it goes crazy. I'm just going to put that below this block of text so you 
        can see it yourself. I did not take my ADHD meds today.
