     <p>This is my fifth blog post. We're just over a month back into school. Somehow, it feels like
        it's been a lot longer and a lot less longer at the same time. There's been times where I've
        been so out of touch with school that I still feel like classes have just started when the
        semester's ending. That probably sounds really concerning. I don't mean from like a "getting my
        work done" perspective, I've always managed to do that. I mean in terms of my mental state.
        Sometimes school just feels like doing daily tasks instead of school. I don't know if that makes
        any sense. This has gotta be my most boring blog post yet. No one wants to read a paragraph about
        me being mentally disconnected from being back at school. I am quite literally writing whatever comes to
        mind right now. Anyways, for today's photo/video you get this cute video of a wild hamster grave
        robbing and eating candle wax. I saw it on a live stream the other day. I think it's neat :)
