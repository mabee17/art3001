     <p>This is my eighth blog post. I have spent the past week home alone, travelling to campus once a week for 
        my mandatory in person class. It's honestly been really really fun, even though it's just me watching
        YouTube and Tik Toks on the couch in the living room instead of my bedroom. I think I've mentioned this 
        before in a previous entry, but I've always been really good at entertaining myself. Just having something
        to watch or a game to play keeps me pretty happy. But unfortunately that's lead to me having this bad habit
        where because I can be entertained by doing almost nothing I'm constantly doing almost nothing. I really
        need to find something to talk about.
