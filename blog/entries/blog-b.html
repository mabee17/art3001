     <p>This is my second blog post. It's hard to believe that we are already at the end of January,
         but at the same time it makes a lot of sense. Just the first week alone was filled with some
         of the craziest shit I've ever seen. Like from the United States capital being raided by Trump
        supporters to rumors of Jeffree Star and Kanye West hooking up. I suppose that's a fitting start
        to 2021 considering what a dumpster fire 2020 was. Honestly though? The internet has made everything
        going on 100 times better (at least from my perspective). Some of the funniest posts I've ever seen
        were a result of all of the crap that happened just this month. Somehow, I'm looking forward to
        what else this already crazy year will bring.
