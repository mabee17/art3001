     <p>This is my fourth blog post. Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and I plan on continuing
        my years-long tradition of spending the day playing Minecraft by myself. Reading that sentence
        back it seems like I'm saying it negatively, but I'm actually looking forward to it. I think
        it's good to have little traditions with yourself like that. Honestly during the pandemic I've
        become a lot more comfortable just being by myself. I've always had the ability to entertain
        myself pretty well but now I like... actively seek it out. Literally just sitting down and 
        watching YouTube videos that I know will make me laugh is so fulfilling. Not sure if this
        is a good or bad thing. I suppose it's both. Anyways, once again I don't really have a particular
        photo in mind, so here's a picture of a baby cow that's almost too adorable to look at directly.
        I love cows.
